## **ðŸŽ“ SRJC Pathway Explorer - WON 3RD PLACE**
SRJC Pathway Explorer is an AI-powered guidance system created to help students at Santa Rosa Junior College find their best academic and career direction. It was developed at the AWS Cal Poly SLO AI Camp 2025 (WON 3RD PLACE).

This project uses an interactive, research-based process enhanced by AI to:
- Identify studentsâ€™ core interests, strengths, and personality traits through structured inputs
- Align them with one of SRJCâ€™s official Academic & Career Interest Areas (Pathways) using AI-driven matching
- Recommend the most relevant majors, certificates, and career options through analysis of student responses
- Connect them with their SRJC House, a built-in support network for belonging and success

The tool uses the widely validated Holland RIASEC career model, and extends it with AI techniques to personalize guidance and make career exploration more accurate.
